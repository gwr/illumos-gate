Build Layout
---

This code is built over in: usr/src/{lib,cmd}/openssl
See comments in the Makefiles over there.

Those Makefiles were derived from the ones produced by:
  ./Configure -DSOLARIS_OPENSSL -DNO_WINDOWS_BRAINDEATH \
  --openssldir=/etc/openssl --prefix=/usr \
  --install_prefix=$ROOT/proto \
  no-ec no-ecdh no-ecdsa no-rc3 no-rc5 no-mdc2 no-idea no-hw_4758_cca \
  no-hw_aep no-hw_atalla no-hw_chil no-hw_gmp no-hw_ncipher no-hw_nuron \
  no-hw_padlock no-hw_sureware no-hw_ubsec no-hw_cswift enable-md2 \
  no-seed no-whirlpool no-whrlpool \
  --pk11-libname=/usr/lib/libpkcs11.so.1 \
  --enginesdir=/lib/openssl/engines \
  threads shared shared solaris-x86-cc-sunw

Note that the opensslconf.h produced by Configure is patched so it
can be used in both 32-bit and 64-bit builds.  We'd rather not run
Configure here, so we store the patched opensslconf.h in files/.


Updating OpenSSL
---

When updating OpenSSL, run configure as shown above and check for
changes in the lists of -D options, list of options, etc.

Be sure to update files/opensslconf.h by running Configure, then
applying files/opensslconf.h.diff to that result and commit.


OpenSSL Version
---

This currently uses OpenSSL 1.0.1h with some updates
from OpenSSL 1.0.2.  Mmost of this is directly from:
  git@github.com:OpenIndiana/oi-userland.git
which in turn came from:
  https://hg.java.net/hg/solaris-userland~gate


Differences from Oracle:

Note Oracle does separate builds for fips/non-fips.
We don't have any fips stuff, so only do non-fips.

Some distros need the ability to "hide" the integrated
OpenSSL in a way that allows the system administrator to
install their own OpenSSL (or whatever).  To support that
use case, the Makefiles over in usr/src know how to build
OpenSSL either "hidden" (behind a sunw_ prefix) or build
all of it exposed as usual, for distros that want that.
See SUNW_OPENSSL in the Makefiles for details.


Patches
---

All directly from the userland gate, except:
09-x86gas-pl.patch	Add .hidden to fix gcc build
10-sparccpuid.patch	Add fixes for .PIC relocations
30_wanboot.patch	Skip! (not building wanboot)
