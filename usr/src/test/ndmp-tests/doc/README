DESCRIPTION
===========
This is the NDMP (Network Data Management Protocol) Protocol test suite.
It automates protocol testing of NDMP server.


PREREQUISITES
=============
1. A tape library is required. 
2. The CTI-TET test harness lite package SUNWstc-tetlite is required.
   You can find the package on the OpenSolaris Test Consolidation:
   http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/testing/testsuites/ctifortet/


CTI-TET INSTALLATION
====================
In the majority of cases, the CTI-TET lite harness can be installed
from packages.  Installation is via the standard Solaris package 
installation tool, pkgadd(1M).  The package is named SUNWstc-tetlite
and it installs into "/opt" by default.

To install SUNWstc-tetlite, enter the following command: 

    root# pkgadd -d <package_location> SUNWstc-tetlite

where <package_location> is the path containing the SUNWstc-tetlite
package directory.  'root#' indicates that this command must be run
as root.

o It is recommended that SUNWstc-tetlite be installed from scratch,
  rather than on top of an existing installation.  Thus, if a copy
  of SUNWstc-tetlite is already installed, remove it:

    root# pkgrm SUNWstc-tetlite


TEST SUITE INSTALLATION
=======================
In the majority of cases, the test suite can be installed from packages.
The package is called SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol and it installs into
"/opt" by default.  Installation is via the standard Solaris package
installation tool, pkgadd(1M).  To install SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol,
enter the following command:

    root# pkgadd -d <package_location> SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

where <package_location> is the path containing the ndmp-protocol test
suite package directory.

It is recommended that the test suite package be installed from scratch,
rather than on top of an existing installation.  Thus, if a version of
the test suite package is already installed, first remove it:

    root# pkgrm SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

It is acceptable to use an NFS-accessible installation of the test suite.

ALTERNATIVELY, the test suite souce code can be installed and the test
suite package can be built from source.  This is optional.  Instructions
for building the test suite are provided in the section titled "BUILDING
TEST SUITE (OPTIONAL)".


TEST SUITE CONFIGURATION
========================
Test suite configuration must be performed as 'root'.

1. Set the following environment variables

	export TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
	export CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
	export PATH=$PATH:$CTI_ROOT/bin
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

The values used above for the different variables are for example only.
Make sure to substitute the correct directory paths based on the actual
install locations of SUNWstc-tetlite and SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

2. To configure the test suite

a. run the following command with the option to configure the test suite 

	root# run_test -v NDMP_SERVER_IP=<ip-address> \
		-v NDMP_USER=<User Name> -v NDMP_PASSWORD=<password> \
		-v NDMP_AUTH=NDMP_AUTH_TEXT -v NDMP_TAPE_DEV=<tape dev> \
		-v NDMP_ROBOT=<tape changer> ndmp/protocol configure \
		-v NDMP_FS=<NDMP server File system to backup>
	
	Example: run_test -v NDMP_SERVER_IP=10.12.178.122 -v NDMP_USER=admin 
		  -v NDMP_PASSWORD=admin -v NDMP_AUTH=NDMP_AUTH_TEXT 
		  -v NDMP_TAPE_DEV=/dev/rmt/0n 
		  -v NDMP_ROBOT=/dev/scsi/changer/c1t210000E08B86CCAFd2
		  -v NDMP_FS=/var/log/
		  ndmp/protocol configure

3. Configuration the NDMP server machine.

a. Create an NDMP admin user on the ndmp server:
	root# ndmpadm enable -a <auth-type> <-u username>

   For example
	root# ndmpadm enable -a cleartext -u admin

   A password will be required; please enter 'admin' as password. 

b. Configure a tape library on the NDMP server machine.

   Get the device mappings on the NDMP server by issuing:
	root# ndmpadm show-devices

Make sure that tape-device has a tape loaded in the drive and is not busy.
The following command displays the status of the magnetic tape drive

	root# mt -f <device-name> status


TEST SUITE EXECUTION
====================
The test suite must be executed as root.

If not already done, from the configuration phase, do the following to 
set the environmental variables:

Using NDMP Protocol test suite  package:
	export TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
	export CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
	export PATH=$PATH:$CTI_ROOT/bin
	export TET_SUITE_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

Once again, the values used above are for example only.  Please make
sure to set the correct values based on the actual install location
of SUNWstc-tetlite and SUNWstc-storage-ndmp-protocol

To run the entire test suite do the following:

    root# run_test ndmp/protocol 

To run all the test purposes:

    root# run_test ndmp/protocol all

To execute individual scenarios, run:
    root# run_test ndmp/protocol <scenario>
For example:
    root# run_test ndmp/protocol MOVER

To execute a Test Purpose within a scenario, run:
    root# run_test ndmp/protocol \
			<scenario>/<test case dir>:<test purpose number>
For example:
    root# run_test ndmp/protocol MOVER/tp_MOVER_ABORT_ISE

Test case directories are CONFIG, DATA, POST, SCSI, MOVER and TAPE.
The log file will be located in /var/tmp/tests directory.


Note: You can define customized test scenarios by adding entries to 
the test scenario file: $TET_SUITE_ROOT/ndmp/protocol/tet_scen.

For how to edit the test scenario file, refer to the TET user guide at: 
        http://tetworks.opengroup.org/tet/

TEST SUITE UNCONFIGURATION
==========================
The test suite must be unconfigured as root.
    root# run_test ndmp/protocol unconfigure

BUILDING THE TEST SUITE (OPTIONAL)
=================================
The following pre-requisites must be satisfied before the test
suite can be successfully built from source.

. Sun Solaris 10 and above Operating System is required.
. Sun Studio 11 should be installed
. Perl 5.8.4 should be installed
. /usr/ccs/bin/make should be used for making

Executing tests using precompiled test suite packages is the method we
strongly recommend.  However, if, for some reason, you need to build
test suite binaries from source, simply do the following:

1. Install SUNWstc-tetlite (see instructions earlier in this file)
2. Obtain the ndmp protocol test suite source
3. Build Test Suite Binaries

(a)  Install SUNWstc-tetlite

Install the precompiled SUNWstc-tetlite package.  Detailed instructions
are provided earlier in this file.

(b) Obtain the ndmp-protocol test suite source

Obtain the test suite source code from your source code repository
which will contain the following directory structure
        <WS_ROOT>/usr/src/suites/storage/ndmp/protocol

where <WS_ROOT> is the root of the workspace under which the
ndmp-protocol test suite resides.

(c) Build Test Suite Binaries

Building test suite binaries does not need 'root' permissions.

	user$ export TET_ROOT=/opt/SUNWstc-tetlite
	user$ export CTI_ROOT=$TET_ROOT/contrib/ctitools
	user$ export PATH=$PATH:$CTI_ROOT/bin
	user$ export TET_SUITE_ROOT=<WS_ROOT>/usr/src/suites/storage/
	user$ cd <WS_ROOT>/usr/src/suites/storage/ndmp/protocol

where <WS_ROOT> is the root of the workspace under which the 
ndmp-protocol test suite resides.  Use 'make' to compile the source:

	user$ make
	...
	... (many lines of 'make' and shell output ensue)
	...

The above command, if successful, will build the test suite 'proto'
directory.  After a successful build, the proto area can be used to 
construct the test suite package:

	user$ make package

This will build the package supported by the current machine's system
architecure (e.g., if building on an x64 system, packages relevant to
the "i386" architecture will be built.)

Once the test suite package has been built, install the package as
instructed in the section "TEST SUITE INSTALLATION" in order to 
install the test suite.
