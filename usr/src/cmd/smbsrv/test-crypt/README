This directory contains a simple test of the encrypt/decrypt interfaces
described by smbsrv/smb_kcrypt.h

To build the tests:
	make install

To run the tests: (on the build system)
	./Run.sh

For debugging, start by uncommenting the dtrace lines in the
Run.sh script, and/or run with gdb (see .gdbrc)

If you need to debug in the crypto provider libraries (or even just
look with gdb) it's easiest to run with a customized pkcs11.conf
See how the Run.sh file sets the environment for that.
Your custom pkcs11.conf file should look like this:
(Substitute your own WS root in there.)
