Don't upstream this file	"%Z%%M%	%I%	%E% GWR"
nor any of the commits that modify this.

I'm using this to create "marker" commits, that I use
sort of like tags, but unlike tags in that they stay
in the correct sequence through rebase actions.

Fixes before start of Zones work.
Fixes after zones work.
Before user-mode SMB server
Before AF_UNIX pipes for RPC
Before extended security
Before first commit of SMB2 support.
Before new DC locator etc.
Before Kerberos inbound
End marker
