Don't upstream this file	"%Z%%M%	%I%	%E% GWR"
nor any of the commits that modify this.

I'm using this to create "marker" commits, that I use
sort of like tags, but unlike tags in that they stay
in the correct sequence through rebase actions.

Added fixes before start of Zones work.
Added smb server in a zone changes.
Before first commit of SMB2 support.
